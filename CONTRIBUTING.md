# Welcome to our Contributing Guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Please read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

This guide will provide an overview of the contribution workflow, including opening an issue, creating a pull request (PR), and the review and merge process.

## Getting Started

### Issues

#### Creating a New Issue

If you come across an issue or have a feature request, please [search if a related issue has already been reported](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If no relevant issue exists, you can open a new issue using the appropriate [issue form](https://github.com/harana/search/issues/new/choose).

#### Solving an Issue

To find an issue that interests you, you can browse through our [existing issues](https://github.com/harana/search/issues) and use the available `labels` to narrow down your search (See [Labels](https://github.com/harana/search/labels) for more information). As a general rule, if you find an issue you want to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Making Changes

#### Making Changes Locally


### Pull Request

Once you have finished making your changes, create a pull request (PR) to submit them.

- Fill out the "Ready for review" template to help reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your PR.
- If you are addressing an existing issue, don't forget to [link your PR to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so that the branch can be updated for merging.
- Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. They may ask questions or request additional information.
- You may be asked to make changes before the PR can be merged, either through [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. For other changes, you can make them in your fork and commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, refer to this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
